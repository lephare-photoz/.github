# LePHARE, a code for the computation of phototmetric redshifts

This organisation hosts various repositories associated with the LePHARE code for calculating photometric redshifts.

These are currently in an early development stage. Please use [the legacy code](https://gitlab.lam.fr/Galaxies/LEPHARE) for installing and running LePHARE while we finalise the new versions.
